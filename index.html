    <meta property="og:description" content="Though neural radiance fields (NeRF) have demonstrated impressive view synthesis results on objects and small bounded regions of space, they struggle on 'unbounded' scenes, where the camera may point in any direction and content may exist at any distance. In this setting, existing NeRF-like models often produce blurry or low-resolution renderings (due to the unbalanced detail and scale of nearby and distant objects), are slow to train, and may exhibit artifacts due to the inherent ambiguity of the task of reconstructing a large scene from a small set of images. We present an extension of mip-NeRF (a NeRF variant that addresses sampling and aliasing) that uses a non-linear scene parameterization, online distillation, and a novel distortion-based regularizer to overcome the challenges presented by unbounded scenes. Our model, which we dub 'mip-NeRF 360' as we target scenes in which the camera rotates 360 degrees around a point, reduces mean-squared error by 54% compared to mip-NeRF, and is able to produce realistic synthesized views and detailed depth maps for highly intricate, unbounded real-world scenes." />

                <p class="text-justify">
                    In the real-world situation, deploying parasite egg detection in the parasite learning chatbot could receive an input that has different distribution from training data. Out-of-domain images in parasite egg detection can lead to incorrect predictions. In testing, we removed out-of-domain images from test data, and the result shows that predictive performance was improved. Solving out-of-domain image problems, we apply out-of-domain images detection to parasite egg detection by using temperature scaling and adding small perturbations to the input. The difference of the SoftMax score distributions can separate in-domain images from out-of-domain images. We abstain out-of-domain images from prediction for more effective detection.
